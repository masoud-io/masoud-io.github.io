						Abstract: A large family of distributed transactional
					protocols have a common structure, called Deferred Update
					Replication (DUR). DUR provides dependability by replicating data,
					and performance by not re-executing transactions but only applying
					their updates. Protocols of the DUR family differ only in behaviors
					of few generic functions. Based on this insight, we offer a generic
					DUR middleware, called G-DUR, along with a library of
					finely-optimized plug-in implementations of the required behaviors.
					This paper presents the middleware, the plugins, and an extensive
					experimental evaluation in a geo-replicated environment. Our
					empirical study shows that:(i) G-DUR allows developers to implement
					various transactional protocols with less than 600 lines of code;
					(ii) It provides a fair, apples-to-apples comparison between
					transactional protocols; (iii) By replacing plugs-ins, developers
					can use G-DUR to understand bottlenecks in their protocols; (iv)
					This in turn enables the improvement of existing protocols; and (v)
					Given a protocol, G-DUR allows to evaluate the cost of ensuring
					various degrees of dependability.</div>

					<br /> Abstract: Reconfiguring a cloud storage system can improve
					its overall service. Tuba is a geo-replicated key-value store that
					automatically reconfigures its set of replicas while respecting
					application-defined constraints so that it adapts to changes in
					clients' locations or request rates. New replicas may be added,
					existing replicas moved, replicas upgraded from secondary to
					primary, and the update propagation between replicas adjusted. Tuba
					extends a commercial cloud-based service, Microsoft Azure Storage,
					with broad consistency choices (as in Bayou), consistency-based
					SLAs (as in Pileus), and a novel replication configuration service.
					Compared with a system that is statically configured, our
					evaluation shows that Tuba increases the reads that return strongly
					consistent data by 63%.

					<br /> Abstract: Modern cloud systems are geo-replicated to
					improve application latency and availability. Transactional
					consistency is essential for application developers, however, the
					corresponding concurrency control and commitment protocols are
					costly in a geo-replicated setting. To minimize this cost, we
					identify the following essential scalability properties: (i) only
					replicas updated by a transaction T make steps to execute T, (ii) a
					read-only transaction never waits for concurrent transactions and
					always commits, (iii) a transaction may read object versions
					committed after it started, and (iv) two transactions synchronize
					with each other only if their writes conflict. We present
					Non-Monotonic Snapshot Isolation (NMSI), the first strong
					consistency criterion to allow implementations with all four
					properties. We also present a practical implementation of NMSI
					called Jessy, which we compare experimentally against a number of
					well-known criteria. Our measurements show that the latency and
					throughput of NMSI are comparable to the weakest criterion,
					read-committed, and between two to fourteen times faster than
					well-known strong consistencies.

					Abstract: In the field of Distributed systems, many experiments require cloud infrastructure.
					However, having a datacenter like architecture is not always possible.
					Therefore we use Distem to emulate geo-replication on Grid’5000 that allows experimentation
					similar to that on the cloud.
					This further allows us to simulate latencies of 100-200 milliseconds as opposed to
					latencies of 10-20 milliseconds observed on Grid’5000.
					We make GDUR, a middleware on Grid’5000, compatible to the geo-replicated setup.
					We discuss the challenges faced in emulating Geo-Replication and thereby study the
					latency-throughput curves on the emulated platform for different protocols in GDUR.

					Ensuring Consistency in Partially Replicated Data Stores. <br />

					<br /> Abstract: Cloud-based applications, such as social
					networking or eCommerce, require to replicate data across several
					sites to provide responsiveness, availability, and disaster
					tolerance. Ensuring consistency over a large scale system with
					slow, and failure prone WANs has become of a paramount importance.
					This thesis studies this issue. In the first part, we study
					consistency in a transactional systems, and focus on reconciling
					scalability with strong transactional guarantees. We identify four
					scalability properties as being critical for scalability: (i) only
					replicas updated by a transaction T make steps to execute T; (ii) a
					read-only transaction never waits for concurrent transactions and
					always commits; (iii) a transaction may read versions committed
					after it started; and (iv) two transactions synchronize with each
					other only if their writes conflict. We show that none of the
					strong consistency criteria ensure all four. We define a new
					scalable consistency criterion called Non-Monotonic Snapshot
					Isolation (NMSI), while is the first that is compatible with all
					four properties. We also present a practical implementation of
					NMSI, called Jessy, which we compare experimentally against a
					number of well-known criteria. Our last contribution in the first
					part is a framework for performing fair, and apples-to-apples
					comparison among different transactional protocols. Our insight is
					that a large family of distributed transactional protocols have a
					common structure, called Deferred Update Replication (DUR).
					Protocols of the DUR family differ only in behaviors of few generic
					functions. We present a generic DUR framework, called G-DUR, along
					with a library of finely-optimized plug-in implementations of the
					required behaviors. Our empirical study shows that: (i) G-DUR
					allows developers to implement various transactional protocols in
					less than few hundreds lines of code; (ii) It provides a fair,
					apples-to-apples comparison between transactional protocols; (iii)
					By replacing plugs-ins, developers can use G-DUR to understand
					bottlenecks in their protocols; (iv) This in turn enables the
					improvement of existing protocols; and (v) Given a protocol, G-DUR
					allows to evaluate the cost of ensuring various degrees of
					dependability. In the second part of this thesis, we focus on
					ensuring consistency in non-transactional data stores. We introduce
					Tuba, a replicated key-value store that dynamically selects
					replicas in order to maximize the utility delivered to read
					operations according to a desired consistency defined by the
					application. In addition, unlike current systems, it automatically
					reconfigures its set of replicas while respecting
					application-defined constraints so that it adapts to changes in
					clients’ locations or request rates. We implemented Tuba on top of
					Windows Azure Storage (WAS). While providing similar API, Tuba
					extends WAS with a broad set of consistency choices,
					consistency-based SLAs, and a geo-replication configuration
					service. Compared with a system that is statically configured, our
					evaluation shows that Tuba increases the reads that return strongly
					consistent data by 63% and improves average utility up to 18%.

					Making Structured Overlay Networks Data Center Friendly. <br />

					(TRITA-ICT-EX-2010:214), The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH).
					September 2010.
				</h3>
				<div>Most existing overlay networks do not consider deployment
					over multiple data centers where peers in a same data center are
					connected with low latency and high bandwidth, while peers in
					different data centers are connected with high latency and medium
					bandwidth. De- ploying these systems on data center infrastructures
					will lead to perfor- mance degradation in lookup latency, and
					inter-datacenter bandwidth consumption. In this dissertation, we
					introduce a new class of overlay networks called data center
					friendly overlays, and characterize their most im- portant
					properties. We also propose a novel gossip generated inter-
					datacenter overlay that can be used on top of any SON in order to
					make it data center friendly. Our solution does not need any
					modifica- tion to routing, and maintenance protocols of the
					underlying SON. It uses the Gradient topology to select the highest
					utility nodes in each DC. These highest utility nodes gossip with
					nodes in other DCs, and build a gossip generated inter-datacenter
					overlay. We also propose a novel broadcast solution using the
					Gradient topology to disseminate gossiped views inside each DC. We
					also compare our solution performance under different scenar- ios
					with Kademlia DHT. Our experiments show that by using inter-
					datacenter overlay on top of a SON, inter-datacenter lookup hops
					re- duce to one while inter-datacenter traffic is kept minimum.
					Moreover, using the inter-datacenter overlay on top of a SON, total
					number of hops decreases, and the whole system performs better
					under churns, and failures.</div>
